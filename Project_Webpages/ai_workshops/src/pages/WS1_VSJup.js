                        <h5> What is Python? </h5>
                        <p> Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Some uses cases involve data science, web programming, and scripting.
                            It is often referred to as more beginner-friendly because of its simpler syntax, and differs from other languages like Java and C++
                            by omitting characters like ";" and blocks wrapped in {"\"{\""} and {"\"}\""} from the syntax. Instead, Python relies on indentation. Python also
                            utilizes <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1517582/what-is-the-difference-between-statically-typed-and-dynamically-typed-languages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
                                dynamic typing</a>. This means type declarations are not a thing in Python - below is an example. </p>

                        <span className="langName">Language: C++</span><br />
                        <code>int x = 5;</code>

                        <h5> Why not PyCharm? </h5>
                        <p>PyCharm is another popular IDE, and it was devloped by JetBrains SPECIFICALLY for developing in Python. But, while it is great for working with
                            Python and managing virtual environments and keeping your projects separate - the free version <i>does not support Jupyter Notebooks</i>!
                            Luckily, as UNLV students, we can apply for their Educational License <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
                                here</a>, but you have to renew yearly which is a hassle. </p>
                        <p>
                            So, while we used PyCharm for our Python Basics Workshop back in November 2024, I would recommend using VSCode going forward because of its lightweight package,
                            flexibility, and customizability.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            PyCharm is still an amazing tool to get used to learning Python - and JetBrains even offers <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm-edu/" target="_blank"

                    <p>Good News!! Python comes <b>pre-installed in modern Linux and MacOS Operating Systems</b>, so if you have a Mac or Linux-based

                            My tutorials will not use Homebrew. Only the Python installed on our machines along with pip (package install for Python),
                            so install Homebrew is not necessary. However, my job is to teach you guys - so I thought I'd mention it!

                            <p> Sorry, you're out of luck :/ . . . is what I woulddd say if WSL (<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a>) didn't exist!
                                I personally have a Mac, so this (and all subsequent) workshops will be targeted for Mac & Linux users specifically.
                            </p>

                                <p>Both MacOS and Linux are based off the Unix Operating System, hence why they are referred to as "Unix-like" Operating Systems.
                                    Windows, on the other hand, is not a Unix-like OS. But, they have recently allowed Windows users to run Linux natively through WSL,
                                    meaning all of the terminal prompts I run will be the same (or similar) for you if you get WSL!
                                </p>
                                <p> To install WSL, please follow the directions here: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install</a></p>
                                <span>P.S. it is not too hard. In PowerShell, simply run:</span>
                                <code>wsl --install</code>

                                <br />
                                <p>Huzzah! Now you have WSL. Get it up and running, then run the following commands:</p>
                                <span>Update package lists (ensures latest versions)</span>

                                virtual environment commands will look slightly different, so some aspects of my tutorials wonâ€™t be directly applicable to you. </p>

                <h4> Virtual Environments 101 </h4>
                <p>One of the best parts about Python is that it is open-source, meaning anyone can contribute to it. Because of this, many people
                    have! There are thousands of Python libraries for many different purposes. However, this comes with a caveat.
                </p>
                <div className="container mt-4">
                    <h5> What are Virtual Environments (venv)? </h5>
                    <p> Different Python projects will require different libraries and packages. Sometimes, those libraries
                        can conflict and/or sometimes projects require certain libraries of particular versions. This can be quite a hassle to manage, and can be avoided by
                        creating a new environment for each project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This strategy provides a separation of concerns, making each project's environment independent of each other. This is what PyCharm does, but
                        since it isn't too complicated to do manually I still prefer VS Code.

                    <p>Creating a venv is very simple now that we have Python. Here's how:</p>

                        <p>We will be using Jupyter Notebook in our Workshops for this reason - it allows us to display snippets of
                            code easily!
                        </p>

                    <p> A Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file) allows us to execute our code in small cells.

                    <p>To set this up in VS Code, let's follow the next couple steps:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Install the "Jupyter" extension by Microsoft in VSCode</li>
                        <div className="container mt-3 mb-3"> <img src={jupExt} alt={"Jupyter Extension on VS Code"} className="ws1-jupext-image" />
                        </div>
                        <li>In your terminal, run the command: </li>
                        <div className="container">
                            <TerminalBlock initialText={"pip install jupyter ipykernel \t # installs jupyter and ipykernel packages"} />
                        </div>
                        <li>Then, run the command:</li>
                        <div className="container">
                            <TerminalBlock initialText={'python -m ipykernel install --user --name=myenv --display-name "Python (myenv)"' +
                                `\n# make sure to replace myenv with the name of your venv folder!`
                            } />
                            <p> That's it for the terminal commands!</p>
                            <p>
                                If you would like to keep a record of these commands, please download the file
                                under <Link to="workshop-resources" smooth={true} duration={100} offset={-300} className="scroll-link">

                            </p>

                        </div>
                        <li>Make a new file called test.ipynb</li>
                        <br />
                        <li>In the upper right of your test.ipynb file, click "Select Kernel" then select your virtual environment.</li>
                        <div className="container"><p> Note: You may have to restart VS Code once or twice to see your venv show up.</p>
                            <img src={selKern} alt={"Selecting Kernel in .ipynb file"} className="ws1-selKern-image" /></div>
                        <br />
                        <li>Create a Code Cell "+ Code" and type the following: </li>
                        <div className="container">
                            <JupyterCell
                                code={`print("Hello World)`}
                                output={`Hello World`}
                            />
                            <p>To run a code cell - click the play button or press "Shift + Enter." You should see the above output.</p>
                        </div>
                    </ol>
                    <h4>We did it!</h4>
                    <p>You now have a functional Jupyter Notebook in VS Code!</p>
                    <p>If you would like to create a simple notebook that visualizes images in a dataset - follow along in the next workshop!</p>
